=====================

Companion Code for my "Apps That Can See" talk at 360iDev 2013

About the Code:

1. Explicit and Redundant to make it easier to follow/explain2. Not production ready - proof of concept quality -for teaching purposes3. Minimum Viable Interface4. Don't hate, okay?
Sample Projects:
1. FaceCounter - Uses CoreImage and OpenCV to detect and count faces in a photo
2. CubeFaceGrabber - Figures out the color squares on one side of a Rubik's cube.  Inspired by [CubeCheater](http://cubecheater.efaller.com)
3. SudokuGrabber - Figures out the numbers in a Sudoku puzzle.  Inspired by [Sudoku Grab](http://sudokugrab.blogspot.com)
